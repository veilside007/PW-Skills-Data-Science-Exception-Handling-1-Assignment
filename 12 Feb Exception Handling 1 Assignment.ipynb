    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional condition arises, an object representing the exception is created and thrown, which can be caught and handled by appropriate exception handling mechanisms. Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, division by zero, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation of the difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - Exceptions occur during the runtime (execution) of a program.\n",
    "   - They represent events that disrupt the normal flow of the program's execution.\n",
    "   - Exceptions can be handled using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `raise` statements.\n",
    "   - Examples of exceptions include `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
    "   - Syntax errors occur during the parsing (compilation) of a program.\n",
    "   - They represent mistakes or violations of the rules of the Python language syntax.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors prevent the program from being executed and must be fixed before the program can run.\n",
    "   - Examples of syntax errors include missing colons (`:`) at the end of `if`, `else`, `elif`, `def`, `class`, etc., misspelled keywords, mismatched parentheses or brackets, etc."

    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it propagates up the call stack until it reaches the outermost scope (the global scope), where it terminates the program and prints a traceback, which includes information about the exception type, the line of code where it occurred, and the call stack leading up to the point of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to demonstrate what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    result = x / y\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "# This function will cause a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "\n",
    "main()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `divide()` function attempts to perform a division operation (`x / y`).\n",
    "- In the `main()` function, we call `divide(10, 0)`, which will result in a `ZeroDivisionError` because we are trying to divide by zero.\n",
    "- Since we have not provided any exception handling mechanism (such as a `try-except` block) to handle the `ZeroDivisionError`, the exception propagates up the call stack.\n",
    "- Eventually, the exception reaches the outermost scope (the global scope), terminating the program and printing a traceback:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 10, in <module>\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 7, in main\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide\n",
    "    result = x / y\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "\n",
    "The traceback shows that the exception occurred in the `divide()` function on line 2, which was called from the `main()` function on line 7, which in turn was called from the global scope. Since the exception was not handled, the program terminates, and the traceback provides information about where and why the exception occurred."

    "Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions. These statements provide a mechanism for gracefully handling errors and preventing them from causing the program to crash.\n",

    "1. **`try` and `except` Statements**:\n",
    "   - The `try` statement is used to enclose the code that may raise an exception.\n",
    "   - The `except` statement is used to catch and handle specific exceptions that occur within the `try` block.\n",
    "   - If an exception occurs within the `try` block, the execution jumps to the corresponding `except` block to handle the exception.\n",

    "Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, are exceptions that are defined by the programmer rather than being built-in to the Python language. They allow programmers to create their own exception classes to represent specific error conditions that are relevant to their application or domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions are useful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expressiveness**: Custom exceptions allow you to define more descriptive and meaningful error conditions tailored to your specific application or domain. This makes it easier to understand and debug code, as the exceptions provide clear indications of what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modularity**: By defining custom exceptions, you can encapsulate error handling logic within the exception class itself, promoting modular and reusable code. This helps in maintaining clean and organized codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchy**: Custom exceptions can be organized into a hierarchy, with base exception classes representing broader categories of errors and more specific subclasses representing specialized error conditions. This allows for more granular error handling and provides flexibility in handling different types of errors.\n",
